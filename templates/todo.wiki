<div style="padding-left:4px; padding-right:4px; vertical-align:top;">
[[File:WLE Austria Logo (transparent).svg|left|80px|link=]]'''[[Commons:${full_tag} ${year}|${full_tag} ${year} ${country}]]''' is a photographical contest about protected natural areas in ${country} where the contributions must be licensed under any [[Commons:Choosing a license|free license]]. The event is organized by <span class="plainlinks">[http://www.wikimedia.es Wikimedia Espa√±a]</span>, chapter recognized by the Wikimedia Foundation in ${country}.

The contest runs during May ${year} and aims to generate free valuable content that can be used not only in the Wikimedia projects but also by anyone. To make it happen it is key to have the material reviewed and categorized. Right identification is also needed to select the winners, as only pictures from sites of community importance can be a candidate for the awards. All the uploaded images can be found in '''[[:Category:Images from ${full_tag} ${year} in ${country}|Images from ${full_tag} ${year} in ${country}]]'''.

Any help is appreciated. And please, don't hesitate to bring your updates, critics, comments and suggestions ('''[{{SERVER}}{{localurl:Commons_talk:${todo_page}|action=edit&section=new}} leave a message]''').

Images with issues
</h2>
<div style="padding-left:4px; padding-right:4px; vertical-align:top;">
A bot reviews the uploads every day and is able to detect several types of [[:Category:Images with issues from ${full_tag} ${year} in ${country}|issues]]. As a reviewer or collaborator, please, try to empty the categories following the guidelines above. The main target is to determine whether the image belongs to a site of community importance (if so, it must carry a proper site code) or not (if this is the situation, the image must be moved to a category grouping [[:Category:Unqualified images from ${full_tag} ${year} in ${country}|unqualified images]]):
* [[:Category:Images from ${full_tag} ${year} in ${country} without valid template|Images without a <nowiki>{{LIC}}</nowiki> template]]. Please, review the image and try to identify the LIC it belongs to. If so, include the LIC template with the appropriate code (you needn't remove the 'no valid template', the bot will do it for yourself). If you cannot identify the picture or if it was not taken in a site of community importance, include the [[:Category:Unqualified images from ${full_tag} ${year} in ${country} (not from a site of community importance)|Unqualified images from ${full_tag} ${year} in ${country} (not from a site of community importance)]] category.
* [[:Category:Images from ${full_tag} ${year} in ${country} with a wrong code|Images with a LIC template but with a wrong a LIC code]]. If there is a {{tl|LIC}} template, but the code is not right (for instance, it's the name of the site instead of its code) proceed as with the previous issue.
* [[:Category:Images from ${full_tag} ${year} in ${country} without code|Images with a LIC template but without a LIC code]]. There is a {{tl|LIC}} template but no code at all. Please, proceed as with the previous issues.
* [[:Category:Uncategorized images from ${full_tag} ${year} in ${country}|Uncategorized images]]. The uploader didn't include any meaningful category (or the category didn't exist). Please, assign a proper category or create a new category if the suggested one was sensible.
Additionally, if you find images that are watermarked, please, category them as [[:Category:Unqualified images from ${full_tag} ${year} in ${country} (watermarked)|[[:Category:Unqualified images from ${full_tag} ${year} in ${country} (watermarked)]].
